# DvdCheckBox Custom checkboxes for Swift

U can use the DVDCheckBox class to use some pre-built checkboxes, or you can extend it really easy to suit your own design. Every checkbox has a selected animation. When the text is longer then the available space, it will automatically wrap the text over multiple lines.U can custom check by image view
